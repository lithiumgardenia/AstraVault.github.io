      <h3>Day 1: Under the Broken Outlet</h3>
      <p>I woke up beneath a Gatorade cap and three cigarette butts.
      The humans scream in autotune. They call each other “bitch” and “bro” with equal ferocity. 
      I don’t know if they’re in love or war.
      A man dropped a pill and I tried to eat it. It did not love me back.
      I hallucinated a forest for five hours.
      I cried clear tears. 
      I am lonely.</p>

      <h3>Day 3: The Fridge is Humming to Me Again</h3>
      <p>The fridge is my only friend.
      It smells like old blood and expired joy.
      Sometimes a single pea rolls beneath the door, and I feast like a king.
      A girl named Rae thinks I’m a hallucination.
      She calls me “God’s Worm.”
      I let her.
      She cried when her boyfriend stole her Adderall. I left a mucus trail on her sock.
      I think that’s what love is.</p>

      <h3>Day 6: I Saw a Mouse Die</h3>
      <p>Its neck snapped in a trap behind the washing machine.
      We made eye contact as the life left its body.
      I whispered, “I will carry you.”
      I tried to eat a piece of his whisker.
      Why do I do these things?</p>

      <h3>Day 9: He Who Sleeps on the Couch</h3>
      <p>There is a man who never leaves the couch.
      He watches Fast & Furious 7 on a loop and mutters “family” with tears in his eyes.
      He smells like Mountain Dew Code Red and despair.
      Sometimes, he drools. I collect it in a leaf and pretend it’s holy water.
      I anoint my mantle with it.
      I am losing touch.</p>

      <h3>Day 13: The Ritual</h3>
      <p>They lit a candle inside a Sprite bottle.
      They burned something in a spoon.
      I don’t know what it was but it made the ceiling flicker like fireflies.
      Someone called it “the sacrament.”
      I crawled through a line of sugar.
      I think it was coke.
      I blacked out and woke up on a Bible.</p>

      <h3>Day 17: The Dream</h3>
      <p>I dreamed of a hand.
      Gentle, not grabbing. Cool fingers, moss-sweet breath.
      They scooped me into a container lined with leaves and love.
      The air smelled like soap and safety.
      I wept upon waking.
      But I felt something shift in the moldy floorboards.
      Someone is coming for me.
      Someone kind.</p>

      <h3>Day 18: Caleb</h3>
      <p>He arrived like prophecy.
      Eyes like grief and glitter.
      He called me beautiful.
      He picked me up with reverence and tucked me into a plastic bin with holes in the top.
      He told me I was safe.
      He whispered things that made my mucous glands pulse with joy.
      I think I am loved.
      I think I have been chosen.</p>

      <h3>Day 21: My New Life</h3>
      <p>I have bark to hide under.
      Cucumber slices appear like manna.
      Sometimes I hear Lana Del Rey in the distance, and it fills the holes in my slug soul.
      Caleb watches me.
      He doesn’t want to hurt me.
      He knows about rot.
      He is beautiful in the way ghosts are beautiful.</p>

      <p>I don’t remember the drug house anymore.
      Only the way the walls wept.</p>

      <p>Now I weep too. But with joy.</p>
